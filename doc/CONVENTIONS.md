# Conventions

## Units

- Energies, momenta, masses are in **[GeV]**
- Distance are in XXX

## Code style

_ I'll probably end up changing these_

- **Indent** = 4 spaces
- **Brackets** are:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i)
{
    doSomething();
}
```
- Class names start with Uppercase, methods and variables start with lowercase. e.g. `MyClass.doSomething()`
- Private class variables start with an underscore
-
